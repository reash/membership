Vino Rojo Project 

Membership Application

This is the second time I have been asked for put together a register for 
a religious organization.  I went looking and didn't find one so this
has become my hobby.

The inital versions are only envisioned to support administrators.  Putting
a membership register on the internet is risky and w8ll take some thought.  The 
initial version will also support mulitiple languages.  The first production
instance will be in Spanish.

Version 1

The first goal of the project is to be able to have a list of everyone 
on the organization.  Each person will belong to a family with a relationship.
Each family has a head of family.  Families can have addresses (both physical
and emails) of different types.

The basic initial functionality will allow for emails with a given attachment
to be sent to members with a given relationship.

The basic functionality will also allow membership lists in xls format to
be imported into the database.

Version 2.

Turn family to member into a many to many relationship so a person can
belong to more than one family.  Something useful as the membership 
register covers more than 1 generation.

Add the ability to track events.

Before using this application, understand your security environment.  The
last thing you want to do is hand a list of your membership with addresses
and emails to a bunch of hackers.
